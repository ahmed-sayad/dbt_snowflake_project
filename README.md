# DBT Snowflake Project

This repository contains a dbt (data build tool) project configured to work with Snowflake as the data warehouse. The project follows dbt best practices for modeling, testing, and documenting data transformations.

## Project Overview

This dbt project transforms raw data in Snowflake into analytical models ready for business intelligence and analytics. The project includes:

- Data models organized in a staging -> intermediate -> mart structure
- Automated testing of data quality
- Documentation of all models and their relationships
- Custom macros for reusable transformations

## Prerequisites

Before using this project, you'll need:

- A Snowflake account with appropriate permissions
- dbt Core installed (version 1.0 or higher recommended)
- Python 3.7 or higher
- A configured profiles.yml file with Snowflake connection details

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure your Snowflake connection in `profiles.yml`
4. Run `dbt debug` to verify your connection
5. Execute `dbt run` to build your models
6. Generate documentation with `dbt docs generate` and view it with `dbt docs serve`

## Key Features

- **Modular Data Modeling**: Follows a clear staging -> intermediate -> mart structure
- **Data Quality Checks**: Built-in and custom tests to ensure data reliability
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting models with column descriptions
- **Incremental Models**: Optimized for large datasets with incremental loads
- **Snowflake Optimizations**: Leverages Snowflake-specific features for performance

## Common Commands

- `dbt run` - Build all models
- `dbt test` - Run data tests
- `dbt run --models staging.*` - Build only staging models
- `dbt snapshot` - Run snapshot models
- `dbt docs generate` - Generate project documentation
- `dbt docs serve` - Serve documentation locally

## Snowflake Configuration

This project assumes the following Snowflake configuration:

- Warehouse: `ANALYTICS_WH`
- Database: `ANALYTICS`
- Schema: `DBT_<USERNAME>`

Adjust these in `dbt_project.yml` or your profiles.yml as needed for your environment.
